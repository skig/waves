ble channel sounding tones analysis tool

## Current status

WIP

ETA of MVP: end of Feb. 2026

## Repo structure
* cs_ini  - channel sounding initiator
* cs_ref  - channel sounding reflector
* toolset - various python tools for channel sounding PBR data processing

## How to build and run

## Background
Channel sounding is BLE 6.0 feature allowing devices to perform measurements of radio medium - specifically, phase and amplitude shift on different channels.

The main use-case is distance measurement allowing users to find distance between two BLE devices.

The repo provides different tools to learn basic principles of CS tones data processing. It aims to lower a threshold to start exploring channel sounding capabilities and demonstrate use-cases beyond distance measurement.
